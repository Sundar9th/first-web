    The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system with a mass of around 330,000 times that of Earth. Did you know that the Sun is made up of mostly hydrogen (three quarters worth) with the rest of its mass attributed to helium.  If the Sun had a voice would it be high and squeaky from all that helium?

    While the entire suit costs a cool $12m, 70% of that cost is for the backpack and control module. However, the space suits that NASA uses were built in 1974.

    There is no atmosphere in space, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard.

    Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system and has an average surface temperature of around 450° C. Did you know that Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun?  That is Mercury.  You would think that Mercury would then be the hottest, but Mercury has no atmosphere (which regulates temperature), resulting in big fluctuations.

    Venus has a slow axis rotation which takes 243 Earth days to complete its day. The orbit of Venus around the Sun is 225 Earth days, making a year on Venus 18 days less than a day on Venus

    Just as colors are made more dramatic in sunsets on Earth, sunsets on Mars, according to NASA,  would appear bluish to human observers watching from the red planet. Fine dust makes the blue near the Sun's part of the sky much more visibilke, while normal daylight makes the Red Planets familiar rusty dust color the most perceptible to the human eye.

    The universe extends far beyond our own galaxy, The Milky Way, which is why scientists can only estimate how many stars are in space.  However, scientists estimate the universe contains approximately 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a septillion.   While no one can actually count every single grain of sand on the earth, the estimated total from researchers at the University of Hawaii, is somewhere around seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains.  That is an awfully big sand castle!

    There are about three trillion trees on Planet Earth, and between 100-400 billion stars, approximately, in the galaxy

    The Sun is large enough that approximately 1.3 million Earths could fit inside (if squashed in) or if the Earths retained their spherical shape then 960,000 would fit. But can you visualise that number of Earths?

    There’s a planet made of diamonds twice the size of earth The "super earth," aka 55 Cancri e, is most likely covered in graphite and diamond.  Paying a visit to that planet would probably pay for the $12 million dollar space suit needed to get there!

    The Apollo astronauts' footprints on the moon will probably stay there for at least 100 million years

    Neutron stars can spin at a rate of 600 rotations per second.

    Thus, upon calculation we find that one hour on Earth is equivalent to seven years in space. Einstein's theory of Special Relativity stands as a explanation to this calculation.

    Of all the planets in our solar system (apart from Earth), Mars is the one most likely to be hospitable to life. In 1986, NASA found what they thought may be fossils of microscopic living things in a rock recovered from Mars.

    This incredible fact is also known as “cold welding” and it happens because the atoms of two pieces of metal have no way of knowing they are separate. This doesn’t happen on Earth because of the air and water found between the pieces.

    Pluto’s largest moon, Charon, is about half the size of this dwarf planet. This makes it the biggest moon in relative size to its parent body. These two are mutually tidally locked to each other. It means that the same side of Charon faces Pluto and vice versa.

    While the nature of black holes is still uncertain, scientists have found out that they are usually around 1/1000th as massive as their home galaxy. The central black hole of the Milky Way, for example, is 4.6 million times the Sun’s mass.

    Space is indeed a very cold place. This is close to absolute zero or −459.67 °F (−273.15 °C) which is the lowest temperature ever possible.

    There are lots of space debris in space called meteoroids. These are usually chunks of comets and asteroids. Sometimes, the Earth passes them in its orbit. These objects burn up in our atmosphere looking like shooting stars.
