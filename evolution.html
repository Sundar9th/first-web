    Some snakes have hipbones, which shows they once had four legs like lizards, their close cousins.
     <hr color="green">
     Bears, seals, and dogs are closely related carnivores but are on a different branch of the evolutionary tree than cats and hyenas.
      <hr color="green"> 
      A panda's "thumb" is a wrist bone that elongated with evolution.
      <hr color="green"> 
      According to 2017 Gallup polls, more Americans believe in global warming than in evolution.
      <hr color="green">
      Most people had brown eyes until about 10,000 years ago when a single genetic mutation from the Black Sea switched the eyes from brown to blue. Approximately 8% of the world’s population now has blue eyes.

      Evolution rarely follows a straight line from species to species. Instead, it is more like a tree with many branches. Some branches lead to new branches, while others become dead ends.
      <hr color="green">
      Birds evolved from dinosaurs and both are descended from reptiles. The closest living reptilian relation of a bird is the crocodile.
      <hr color="green">
      Inside some whales and dolphins are small bones that show they once had back legs and that their ancestors walked on land. These occasionally reappear as tiny rear flippers.
      <hr color="green">
      The term “evolution” dates from the Latin evolutionem, meaning “unrolling” or “an opening of what was rolled up.”
      <hr color="green">
      Researchers believe that goose bumps are a remnant of thick hair that covered early humans.
      <hr color="green">
      Evidence for evolution is continually being gathered and tested; consequently, scientists argue that evolution is both a fact and a theory.
      <hr color="green">
      Many people feel the urge to lift their feet or climb to a more elevated position when scared or feeling anxious. Evolutionary biologists claim this is a remnant instinct from when early ground-dwelling mammals would climb trees when threatened.
      <hr color="green">
      Historically, men prefer women with an hourglass figure. Researchers believe this is a product of evolution because the waist-hip ratio (WHR) serves as an indicator of reproductive health.
